N/Script is a programming language based on Python. The language is aimed at programs

# Installing
- Install a repo
- extract it in any folder
- Create in ```NSScript path/Projects``` file ```main.nss```
- Open ```Interpreter.py``` and write ```nslash1 main.nss``` for open main.nss

# Syntax
the syntax in n/script is based on classes and functions, for example, to write output text to the console you need to write ```console.say("")```
where "console" is a class, "say" is a function and the value is in parentheses. Almost all code adheres to this principle except for variables. They are written in the same way as in Python.
